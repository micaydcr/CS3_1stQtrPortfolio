# **Quarter 1 End of Lessons Reflections**
### *Made by: Michaela Alexa DC. Rubico from 9 - Rubidium* ###


## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **JavaScript Operations (Arithmetic Operators)** - Arithmetic operators are simply the symbols that are used in JavaScript when dealing with operations on numbers. An example is when x++ is inputted, tha value of x + 1 will be the output.
2. **JavaScript Operations (Assignment Operators)** - Assignment operators are used to assign the values of the variables in programming. This comes in different forms depending on what you want to assign, but the main symbol is the equal sign (=). For example, the addition assignment (x += y) will result as x = x + y.
3. **JavaScript Operations (Logical Operators)** - Logical Operators are used to determine the relationship of 2 or more variables that will return a boolean value, unless if the operators are used with non-boolean values. The three logical operators that were taught to us were and (&&), or (||), and not (!).
4. **Variable Declaration** - In declaring variables in JavaScript, we often use var, let, or const depending on what we are declaring. While in naming the variables, we can use letters, numbers, and undscore, but it cannot start with a number. Another thing to take note is the data type of the variableâ€”whether it's a string, number, boolean, and many more.
5. **HTML Tags** - HTML tags contain certain words that are enclosed in brackets (<>). These are used to let us run and code our program in a organized and correct way. 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **JavaScript Operations (Comparison Operators)** - Comparison operators is used to compare the values stored in variables. I encounter difficulties in this topic, especially during objective quizzes or exams, because I somehow get confused whether the value is true or false.
2. **Nested Loops** - Though nested loop is just a type of loop containing more loops, I still get confused sometimes that will result of an error in the program. Situations like these happen espeially when i repeat if statements with console.log multiple times.
3. **If Statements** - I sometimes experience difficulties with if statements since I get confused which condition I will write. There are times wherein we need to use more than one comparison operators and this where i tend to mix things up, resulting with the wrong coding program 
4. **If-else Statements** - When it comes to if else statements, I often interchange the postion that it should belong to. This causes my code to still run, but produce the wrong outcome.
5. **For and While Loops** - I encounter confusion with for and while loops because I often interchange them. Like sometimes, I would use for loops for condition that doesn't have a specific limit and vise versa.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. My plan of action is to practice coding programs during my free time or even if I'm just reviewing. In addition to this, I can also ask and consult with Sir Roy when I encounter these problems during classes. This way, I can slowly get used to the logic and avoid confusion.

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

### Effective 
1. The first activity that I find effective is when we will be given exercises with a template that shows the function/variable declaration already and we will just input the missing statements (or anything) that are needed. This helps me understand the structure better and focus how the comupter will understand my code.
2. The second one is when we follow along with the code Sir is writing while he explaining it. this helps me learn the lesson easier because I understand the flow of the program.

### Not Effective

1. The only thing that I find not effective is when Sir discusses a bit faster that usual. This causes me to be overwhelmed and just give up ðŸ¥²
2. Wala na po, Sir !!
